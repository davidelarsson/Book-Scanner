Thoughts:


Permissions:
* If using the camera via an Intent, no android.permission.CAMERA is required.
* Experiment a little with the camera permissions, one has to have the ability
  to choose which camera to use, right?
* Don't use external SD card storage, we only need to send the picture to the
  server!


* Maybe use  share via SFTP?
  * Forget SCP or SFTP for now. Use FTP?
